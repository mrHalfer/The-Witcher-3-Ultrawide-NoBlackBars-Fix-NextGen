# witcher3UWfix
Patch for ultrawide resolutions in The Witcher 3 game

The game itself supports ultra-wide monitors, but there is no cutscene.

This fix will allow you to fix the aspect ratio in an automatic way.

Place the tool in the same folder as witcher3.exe (/bin/x64/ or /bin/x64_dx12)

Run the tool and follow instructions
